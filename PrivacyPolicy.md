### Permissions:
The following permissions are utilized by the app. If you do not grant them, the app may not function properly and may crash unexpectedly:

- "android.permission.INTERNET" = Used to access the internet and in game, google play leaderboards/achievements.
- "android.permission.NOTIFICATIONS" = Used to allow us to send you notifications! This permission is optional and can be changed in settings if needed.
- "android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" = Used on first boot to display a google play games sign in popup. Also used to display if you're logged in.

- "android.permission.NOTIFICATIONS" = used for notifications in versions of android < 13
- "OnBackInvokedCallback" = used to allow me to impliment or stop gestures in the app. I use this to stop "swipe backs" as it corrupts the game data.
- "android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" = Allows the app to restart hunger and notification processes after a reboot of the device. These processes are important to the app and vital for a smooth experience.
- "android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" = Currently required to help smooth the recievers used for notifications and duck hunger. I am currenbtly testing/working on a method for this permission to not be required.

The app DOES NOT read any data from your device other than the app data. The app data includes the app itself and any shared preference files created by the app/user.


### Definitions:
- Shared Preferences: A function used in Android app development that allows the app to store values for use later or even after app closure. In my app, it's used to store your app data, settings and progress. This includes data like what ducks/backgrounds are unlocked, along with current scores and currency amounts. This data can only be accessed by the app and is only stored on your device. To clear it, clear the app data or app cache. This will completely reset the app.
- Google Play Games: A service created by google to improve gaming on mobile. It includes a vairiety of features such as achievemnets for your game profile, leaderboards, friends and game backups. In my app I use it as another way to track achievements and use its built in leaderboard functions for a vairiety of in game leaderboards to compete on.
- Firebase Server: Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android, and Web apps. Firebase provides lots of tools, including the ability to store data for programs to use and update that data in real-time as the user/developer changes it.
