### Definitions:
- Shared Preferences: A function used in Android app development that allows the app to store values for use later or even after app closure. In my app, it's used to store your app data, settings and progress. This includes data like what ducks/backgrounds are unlocked, along with current scores and currency amounts. This data can only be accessed by the app and is only stored on your device. To clear it, clear the app data or app cache. This will completely reset the app.
- Google Play Games: A service created by google to improve gaming on mobile. It includes a vairiety of features such as achievemnets for your game profile, leaderboards, friends and game backups. In my app I use it as another way to track achievements and use its built in leaderboard functions for a vairiety of in game leaderboards to compete on.
- Firebase Server: Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android, and Web apps. Firebase provides lots of tools, including the ability to store data for programs to use and update that data in real-time as the user/developer changes it.
